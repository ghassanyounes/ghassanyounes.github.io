        <p>
          I'm Ghassan Younes, a Computer Engineering student at DigiPen Institute of Technology. I also run a crafting business - <a href="store/index.html">Ghassan Younes Makes</a> - that I run both online and at various Artisan and Maker fairs in the Greater Seattle Area. I'm Lebanese and Greek, and I'm very proud of my heritage, which I love to showcase in my work. In that spirit, I designed my logo to be a combination of the first characters in my name in the Arabic (غ) and Latin (G) scripts. Through it I hope to encapsulate who I am and what I represent. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I've had a passion for tinkering and making things throughout my whole life, and that's shown itself in both my professional career and in my crafting business. When it comes to computers, they always captivated me. I started on my parents' yellow-beige Windows 95 PC, browsing the web and slowly building up a knowledge base that turned me into the IT resource for my entire family. Unsurprisingly my education in computer engineering has only cemented my status there. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Speaking of my degree, I am pursuing my Bachelors of Science Computer Engineering at DigiPen Institute of Technology, where I am focusing in embedded systems and microcontroller development. I hope to focus more in CPU and GPU architecture moving forward as those fields have always been fascinating to me. I also have familiarized myself with FPGA development and graphical programming using C++, more of which is detailed in my <a target=blank href="./projects.html">professional life</a> page.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other side of what I do, there is my crafting business, which I started as a hobby of mine but it became so much more. As a kid, I'd always mess around with ribbons and fabric at my aunt's store in Hamra, which is definitely where my interest began. Since then I've learned much in the realms of the fiber arts, woodworking, leatherworking, and glass painting. My drive and creative energy always pushed me forward and were the active force in starting my business. You can check out my <a target=blank href="./projects.html">storefront</a> for more!
