    <p id="report">This week I finally sent in the PCB for the DART!. I'm excited to get it in so I can work on the tank without the risk of a breadboard flying off. The next steps are to complete the chassis for the ultrasonic and infrared sensors as well as to write the code implementing the PID loop on the tank.</p>
